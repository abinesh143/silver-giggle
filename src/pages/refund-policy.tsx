                    Personal Information. We collect Personal Information that
                    you provide to us and that may be used to identify you
                    (“Personal Information”). Personal Information that we
                    collect may vary with each separate purpose for which you
                    provide it, and it may include one or more of the following
                    categories: name, physical address, an email address, phone
